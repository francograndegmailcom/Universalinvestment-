mutual funds, trust funds, swaps, options, special investment vehicles) as well as decision-making potential markets with quick, sensitive, accurate quality and a multi-stake
perspective that could avoid negative facts of asymmetric information.
This benefits will be generated through private investment as a first shape, depth, speed and weight indication of the sinergy this wants to attain but afterwards will result in 
public and private measurable (economics) and unmeasurable (social and politics) consecuencies that can give place to interests on the public to pursue and co-fund. Main concerns 
are world peace, food production increment, decreasing distributions costs, foster new technologies, avoid geo-political disputes, diminish risk and lack of information in complex
real investment projects that being funded without this software would be unaffordably expensive due to conflict of interests, negative sinergies, environmental misgivings, and high kick-off costs.
